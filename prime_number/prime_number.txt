A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. In other words, a prime number can only be divided evenly (without leaving a remainder) by 1 and by the number itself.

Write Java program that checks if a given number is a prime number.

public static boolean isPrime(int number){..}
